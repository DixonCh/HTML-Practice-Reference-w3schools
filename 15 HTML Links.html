HTML Links:

Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.

HTML Links - Syntax
Hyperlinks are defined with the HTML <a> tag:

<a href="url">link text</a>
  
Example:
  
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.w3schools.com/html/) of the link.

The link text is the visible part (Visit our HTML tutorial).

Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.

Note: Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will 
automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request.

Local Links:
  
The example above used an absolute URL (a full web address).

A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without https://www....).

Example:
  
<a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a>
  
HTML Links - The target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame
  
This example will open the linked document in a new browser window/tab:

Example:
  
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
Tip: If your webpage is locked in a frame, you can use target="_top" to break out of the frame:

Example:
  
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_top">HTML tutorial!</a>
HTML Links - Image as a Link
It is common to use images as links:

Example:
  
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">
</a>
  
Note: border:0; is added to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image (when the image is a link).

Button as a Link:
  
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

Example:
  
<button onclick="document.location = 'default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>
  
Tip: Learn more about JavaScript in the JavaScript Tutorial of w3schools.

Link Titles:
  
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse 
moves over the element.

Example:
  
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit HTML Tutorial of w3schools</a>
  
External Paths:
  
External pages can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

This example uses a full URL to link to a web page:

Example:
  
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

This example links to a page located in the html folder on the current web site:

Example:
  
<a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

This example links to a page located in the same folder as the current page:

Example:
  
<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths.
