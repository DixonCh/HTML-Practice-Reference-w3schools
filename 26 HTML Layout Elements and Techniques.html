HTML Layout Elements and Techniques:

Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or newspaper).

Example:

Cities
London
Paris
Tokyo
London
London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million 
inhabitants.

Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans,
who named it Londinium.

HTML Layout Elements
HTML offers several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5       Semantic Elements	
<header>  - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav>     - Defines a container for navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
<aside>   - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer>  - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
You can read more about semantic elements in our HTML Semantics chapter.

HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons:

CSS framework
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS grid
CSS Frameworks
If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

CSS Float Layout
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter.

CSS Flexbox Layout
Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3.

Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
